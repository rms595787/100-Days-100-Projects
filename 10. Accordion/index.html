                HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the
                web. It uses a system of tags and elements to define the structure of web pages, telling browsers how to
                display text, images, links, and other components. Think of it as the foundational skeleton for every
                website.

                CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used in web development to
                control the presentation and formatting of HTML documents. Essentially, it dictates how web pages should
                appear visually, separating the content (defined in HTML) from its style.

                JS is the common abbreviation for JavaScript, a dynamic and interpreted programming language primarily
                used for web development. It is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web, working
                alongside HTML (which provides the structure of a webpage) and CSS (which handles the styling).

                React, often referred to as React.js or ReactJS, is an open-source JavaScript library for building user
                interfaces (UIs). Developed and maintained by Facebook (now Meta), it is widely used for creating
                dynamic and interactive web applications.

                Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to
                execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which is
                known for its high performance.
